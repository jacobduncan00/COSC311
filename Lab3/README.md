# What are some ways you would visualize the overall productivity of this set of cities? What sort of plotting could you do, and what quantitative questions could it answer? Implement your choice of visualization and answer your questions.

I think we can visualize the overall productivity of this set of cities by analyzing the number of imports and exports of each city and then plotting those on a bar graph for each city to see which ones have more or less than others.
I would do bar graph plotting. I think it could answer the amount of imports and exports per city as well as the overall productivity of each city. From my visualization we can see that in my example, city with ID 1 gets more imported than they export. However, for the other cities the imports and exports are the same.

# What additional information about this data set might you want to request, and what new questions could you answer or explore with it?

I would want to have a quantitative piece of information regarding how many 'lbs' or some sort of data unit of each import and export they bring in or ship out each month, then we can really scale productivity if we know that and the amount of work put into that we can calculate productivity very easily.

# What are the different “meanings” of each one, in relation to the underlying data?

- Mean - the average of a data set. Calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the number of entires in the data set. The underlying meaning in this dataset would be
- Median - the meadian of data set is the middle entry when the data set is sorted.
- Mode - the mode of the data set is the entry that appears the most in the data set.

# Computationally, how difficult is each one to compute (using basic approaches from the definitions)?

These are seemingly easy to compute for mean, you take all the values of the data set and sum them and then you divide by the number of entries in the data set. For the median, you can sort the data set and then find the middle entry and that will be your median for the data set. For the mode, you can count the number of times you see an entry in the data set and store it off and then go back and look and see which entry you saw most and that is your mode for the dataset.
