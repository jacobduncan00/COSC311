#  Comment on the performance of the classifier and argue which value of k you would choose. What is the classification rate for k*, your chosen value of k? Also report the classification rate for k* + 2 and k* - 2. How does the test performance of these values of k correspond to the validation performance? 

The classifier performs pretty good on the validation set K = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. As you can see in the plot, the classifier predicts correctly about 82% of the data points. However, different K values do perform differently. I think a good value to choose for K would be 5. The classification rate for k* is 0.86. The classification rate for K* + 2 is 0.86 and K* - 2 is 0.86. The test performance of the values of K are similar. ~5.7 or 5.8 would still be the best choice where as 3 seems to be a worse choise but better than 1 and 9. However, we can expect these because we know that K goes to 0, the model underfits the data and when k goes to infinity, the model overfits the data. Both won't result in the best rate, therefore a middle value of K is preferred.
